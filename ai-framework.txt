//First we have to create a virtual enviroment
1. First install Python
    python -m venv venv
	
2.Activate:
	Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
	Linuz: source myenv/bin/activate
	
3.Install packages
		pip install tensorflow, torch, scikit-learn, etc
		
4. Create your own code.	
		python main.py
		

//Now ways to play in your local enviroment
1.Image Classification
			1.Pre-trained models exist, such as HuggingFace, MobileNet, ResNet
			2. Custom build
			
2.Natural Language Processing
			1. Program yourself, or hire Daily lol
			2. Use pre-built sentiment analysis on your text data with models such as Bert, GPT, etc
			3. Try transformers, or RNNS
			
//Try with Chatbots
	1.Build using pre-built such as ChattrBot, or customise your own

//Reccomendation System
	1. Convert speech to text using models like DeepSpeech, Google-Text, etc

//Generative Adveersarial Networks
	1. Generate realistic images, or text GANS

//Time Series Forecasting
	1.Predict stock prices, movies, age by building custom or using ARIMA, LSTM, etc

//Autonomous Driving
	1.Simulate
	2. Reinforce
